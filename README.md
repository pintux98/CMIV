# CMIV
Reimplementation of CMI Bungee addon, but for Velocity Proxy Servers. 

Download: [SPIGOT](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi-velocity.111751/)

This is a simple port of the CMIB (CMI Bungee) plugin, but for Velocity Proxy Servers.

It works with the latest [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi-298-commands-insane-kits-portals-essentials-economy-mysql-sqlite-much-more.3742/) , but should be working for older ones too.

For BungeeCord please use this instead [HERE](https://www.zrips.net/cmib/)

For bugs please open an issue [HERE](https://github.com/pintux98/CMIV/issues)
